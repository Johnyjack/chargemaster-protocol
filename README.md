# chargemaster-protocol
USB protocol of Chargemaster 2 compatible battery chargers

This Repository contains documentation and code generated from the reverse engineering process.

The goal of this work is to make battery chargers with SkyRC/Hitec Chargemaster 2 USB interface controllable without having to use the Windows GUI tool Chargemaster 2. 

The code is written to interface to the charger on a linux system.

The documentation and code is not yet complete. Work is in progress. Contributions are welcome.

Currently the work is conducted with a Turnigy Accucell-6 80W battery charger (as this is the only charger available to the author). Please contact the author if you are capable of capturing USB data from other chargers, contributing to the repository or providing an untested charger.

Tested Chargers:
-Turnigy Accucel-6 80W 10A Balancer/Charger LiHV Capable
    Product ID: 9052000071-0 (from HobbyKing Website)

Status: The next activity on this repository will most likely not be before spring 2016.
